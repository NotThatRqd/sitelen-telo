1.02 8/6/2025
changes to the font:
- moved all linja telo symbols to the correct codepoint according to sitelen pona UCSUR standards
    * itomi, pa, pata, sutopatikuna, and alu don't have standardized codepoints in the UCSUR sitelen pona standard, I've set them to U+FFB49, U+FFB66, U+FFAE5, U+FFAFB, U+FFB40, matching what the Fairfax font does for these words
    * removed redundant "ee", "ii", "uu" glyphs
    * moved "a" glyph giving it a primary codepoint matching UCSUR and an alternate codepoint to lowercase latin letter a
    * moved "o" glyph giving it a primary codepoint matching UCSUR and an alternate codepoint to lowercase latin letter o
- moved "period" glyph giving it primary codepoint of SITELEN PONA MIDDLE DOT and an alternate codepoint to FULL STOP (.)
- moved "colon" glyph giving it primary codepoint of SITELEN PONA COLON and an alternate codepoint to COLON (:)
- added glyphs for vertical presentation forms of colon, semicolon, exclamation mark, question mark, ideographic full stop, ideographic comma
- removed ligatures that combine certain words such as seme followed by a question mark into looking like seme and a period
- removed codepoint association from "extraspace" and other punctuation ligatures (still accessible via ligatures)
- added ligatures that are ucsur friendly
    * for example "eni" glyph can be accessed via "e" + "ni" or "e" + "n" + "i" now, previously was only "e" + "n" + "i"
- removed "test" glyph that looked the same as the "pan" glyph
- added dedicated glyphs for linja sin that have a trailing n for better vertical support
- simplified naming of linja sin N consonant glyphs, "N" is the starting consonant and "trailingn" is the trailing consonant
    * "N" has an alternate codepoint to uppercase latin letter N
    * "trailingn" can be accessed via ligature "N" + "N"
- moved individual linja sin consonant glyphs J, K, L, M, N, P, S, T, W, to U+EE00 to U+EE08 with alternate codepoints to their uppercase latin equivalents
- moved "trailingn" to U+EE09
- moved all linja sin glyphs to new codepoints using this formula:
    * codepoint = S_base + (l_idx * N_V * N_T) + (v_idx * N_T) + t_idx
    * S_base = U+EE10 is the starting point of where all the linja sin glyphs are located
    * l_idx is the index of the starting consonant (0 is none, 1 is J, 2 is K, ...)
    * v_idx is the index of the medial vowel (0 is A, 1 is E, ...)
    * t_idx is the index of the trailing consonant (0 is none, 1 is trailing N)
    * N_V = 5 is the number of vowels
    * N_T = 2 is the number of trailing consonants (2 because it is including the case where there is none)
    * this is modeled off of how it is done for Korean Hangul
additional changes:
