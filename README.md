# Sitelen Telo

Script for writing Toki Pona. Please read the main PDF named "sitelen_telo_1.02.PDF" to get started.

Note: The new 1.02 font (the OTF file) is really good, although if you have improvements please open a pull request, but the new main document (the PDF/ODT) is a little weird because it uses both ligatures and UCSUR at the same time, I'm not sure if that affects the ability to do text searches in it. If there's a problem please just open a new issue üëç
